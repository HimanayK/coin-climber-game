Create a simple Super Mario-style 2D platformer game using Kaboom.js. The game should be playable in the browser and include the following:

1. A player character that can:
   - Move left and right using arrow keys
   - Jump using the up arrow
   - Be affected by gravity
   - Land and stand on platforms

2. A game scene that includes:
   - A background color or image
   - A solid ground platform
   - A few floating platforms to jump on

3. Use placeholder rectangles or simple sprite boxes if sprite images are not available.

4. The game should be built using:
   - One HTML file (`index.html`) that includes a `<canvas>` and links to Kaboom.js and the game script
   - One JavaScript file (`game.js`) that contains the Kaboom.js logic

Start with a minimal working version, and keep the code simple and easy to understand for someone new to coding. Use comments to explain key parts.

Use the latest version of Kaboom.js (via CDN) in the HTML file.
